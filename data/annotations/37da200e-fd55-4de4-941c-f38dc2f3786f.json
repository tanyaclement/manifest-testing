And I think the men are coming to see women as people and interact with them on that basis. And I think that the relationships that are being formed are just much more healthy because of this. But I did notice changes in the men students even within the first term. In the autumn, I found that in a large lecture situation, say two or three hundred students, if a woman would comment on something in class or ask a question, the men were very surprised and they'd look around and sort of look and sort of think it over, hm, listen to all these nice things coming out of this, this, this woman. They seem to be very surprised. And I found this was particularly for the upper classmen, the people who had been here two or three years. And they seemed very struck. And just sort of musing about the whole situation. And as the term wore on, I felt the people began to be more comfortable with each other and indeed come to see each other as people. And I think that's the the main advantage to coeducation, as it's turned out here at Yale."

There was a girl on a panel, there was a meeting at Sprague Hall the other day and there was a girl on the panel, and I think some of the women are the worst offenders. You know what I mean? They don't take it seriously. And they're, I mean, they should be pretty angry about the way we're treated here, and a lot of them just aren't. And um, I'd like to see the women more conscious about being women."
